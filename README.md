# RANDOM-FOREST

### IMPLEMENTION OF RANDOM FOREST USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT HEART ATTACK

- Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique
- It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in Machine Learning
- It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model
- Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset
- Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using RANDOM FOREST MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated
